      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about">
        <img src="images/your-photo.jpg" alt="Michael Roper">
        <p>I'm an experienced AV producer and event manager with over 15 years of technical and creative expertise across live broadcasting, corporate events, and conferences.
           From Sky Sports and BBC Red Button coverage to international sports events like the IFSC World Cup, I've led vision mixing, camera operation, 
           and full production crews on global broadcasts.</p>
        <p>I have worked across high-profile award shows, exhibitions, and hybrid conferences, both on-site and remotely. 
          Whether planning from scratch or adapting in high-pressure environments, I excel at managing AV teams, delivering complex logistics, and ensuring seamless show execution from pre-production to final execution.</p>
        <p>With a background that includes customer-facing roles for example bar management, cruise ship operations, I bring a calm and confident presence to any production. I also have strong technical knowledge of cameras, vision systems, studio lighting, Zoom, Teams, OBS, and AV workflows. I hold a full UK driving licence, and I'm  passionate about sports, team spirit, and delivering memorable live experiences.</p>

          <p>Michael led a great team that produced the live broadcast of a world championships event we hosted. He's talented, professional, and has a tremendous dedication to quality production. A hard worker, and also quite fun to work with. I highly recommend him. <br><strong>– Kimanda Jarzebiak, Ascent Public Affairs / Boulders Climbing Gym / CBC Olympic Analyst</strong></p>

          <p>From the initial kick off meeting, I felt our event was in safe hands. I couldn’t be more grateful to Michael and the team for helping to deliver an incredible award ceremony that has been called a benchmark event in regional tourism awards. From designing the set and stage, to testing the sound and lighting levels for the sharks in the fish tank, they took a huge amount of care with every step to ensure the event not only hit the brief and wowed our client but remained in our tight budget. I couldn’t have asked for any more from Cue Media and look forward to working with them again soon. <br><strong>– Tourism Awards Organiser</strong></p>

          <p>Working with Michael and the Cue team was a pleasure from start to finish. They really took the time to understand our vision, then worked tirelessly to bring it to life. I really appreciated their expert insights and honesty – they were very quick to tell us when they didn't think we needed to spend more money, which is a refreshing approach to business! The event was a huge success, and we look forward to working with Cue again in the future. <br><strong>– Director of Public Affairs and Policy</strong></p>
