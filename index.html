          <p>"Michael led a great team that produced the live broadcast of a world championships event we hosted. He's talented, professional, and has a tremendous dedication to quality production. A hard worker, and also quite fun to work with. I highly recommend him." <br><strong>– Kimanda Jarzebiak, Ascent Public Affairs / Boulders Climbing Gym / CBC Olympic Analyst</strong></p>

        <div class="testimonial">
          <p>"From the initial kick off meeting, I felt our event was in safe hands. I couldn’t be more grateful to Michael and the team for helping to deliver an incredible award ceremony that has been called a benchmark event in regional tourism awards. From designing the set and stage, to testing the sound and lighting levels for the sharks in the fish tank, they took a huge amount of care with every step to ensure the event not only hit the brief and wowed our client but remained in our tight budget. I couldn’t have asked for any more from Cue Media and look forward to working with them again soon." <br><strong>– Tourism Awards Organiser</strong></p>

          <p>"Working with Michael and the Cue team was a pleasure from start to finish. They really took the time to understand our vision, then worked tirelessly to bring it to life. I really appreciated their expert insights and honesty – they were very quick to tell us when they didn't think we needed to spend more money, which is a refreshing approach to business! The event was a huge success, and we look forward to working with Cue again in the future." <br><strong>– Director of Public Affairs and Policy</strong></p>
